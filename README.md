NPC with simple building mechanic using finite state machine and binary tree.

Controls:
(R) - Reset
(B) - switch between play/build modes
RightClick - Move Character
LeftClick - Place building to be built
LeftClick Drag - Rotate building before placing

Control your character (Cyan) to move around (Right-click)

NPC's default is to just wander and go to random places
Once you've placed a "blueprint" of an object, the NPC will start building the blueprint by gathering a resource from the base and placing it on the blueprint.

NPC will repeat this loop until all buildings have been built and the NPC will return to wandering state
